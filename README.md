# Vision Transformer (ViT) for Image Classification

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) for image classification tasks. ViT, originally proposed by Alexey Dosovitskiy et al., leverages the transformer architecture's attention mechanism to process image data. The model breaks down an image into patches, embeds them, and utilizes a transformer network for global context understanding, achieving impressive results in computer vision tasks.

## Key Features:

- **Patch Embedding:** Converts image patches into embeddings for processing.
- **Attention Mechanism:** Applies transformer-style attention for capturing long-range dependencies.
- **Multi-head Self-Attention:** Enhances feature representation through multiple attention heads.
- **Positional Embeddings:** Incorporates spatial information into the model.
- **MLP Blocks:** Employs Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) blocks for non-linear transformations.

## Results:
The model achieved state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of ViT in image classification tasks.

## Acknowledgments:
This implementation is based on the original !(ViT paper by Dosovitskiy et al.) [https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929] and incorporates PyTorch's powerful functionalities.
